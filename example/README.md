# A small example

This is a small example that shows how [minimal-zip-file-creator](https://github.com/henbr/minimal-zip-file-creator) can be used when doing bulk download. All files are packaged into a single zip file instead of creating a new download for each file.

How to run the example:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
